# we can use modules to better organisize our code

# 2 ways to use inheritance


#Method 1
# import inheritance
# inheritance.name("Devesh")


#Method 2

from inheritance import name
name("Nidhi")

#difference between these 2 is - in method one -> users need to access methods via object
# in method 2 - > specific function is already mentioned that is why we don't need it use access it via object
